# GBA-Breakout
Breakout on the GameBoy Advance

This is a side project with the goal of implementing [Atari's Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) on the Gameboy Advance (to an extent). 

##How to compile
The Makefile works on UINX like systems with the devkitARM tools. Specific information and compilation instructions
can be found on the devkitPro [website](http://devkitpro.org/). That site should have all the tools needed. I've
also included a compiled .gba file to run.
